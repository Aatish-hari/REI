A shell should work like this..., MAYBE.. ??
-Shell looping
-Parsing
-Command execution 
-Handle Built in commands
-Execute external commands
-env variables
-Path
-Error Handling

1.external command =>
    does NOT live inside the shell
    exists as a separate executable file on disk
    is run by the shell using fork() + execve(), example 'ls', 

    What actually happens when 'ls' is written:
    Shell looks for ls in PATH
    Finds /bin/ls
    Forks
    Child calls:
    execve("/bin/ls", ["ls", NULL], envp);

2.environment variables
    Environment variables are just key–value strings that your shell keeps and passes to every program it runs.
    Example:
    PATH=/bin:/usr/bin
    HOME=/home/user
    USER=alice      example: ls need PATH to run

3. Manage Path
    using the value of PATH to find executables
